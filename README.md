### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello! I'm a Freshman in High School, and my biggest interest is programming. Specifically, I like to make Deep Learning/Neural Networks/AI. I geenerally code in Python, and JavaScript sometimes.

### What I'm Working on/Learning

- NBA Player Detection Algorithm (bounding box stuff)

### Future/Possible Projects

- Something with Canvas API
- Neural Style Transfer
- Obstacle Course AI (Customizable!)
- Rap Lyrics Generator
- Music Generation AI
- LED Music Visualizer
- Pose Estimation Algorithm using Convolutional Neural Networks (using NBA footage)
- Portfolio Website using HTML, CSS, JS, Django
- Generative Chatbot/Voice Assistant()
- Self driving car RL Algorithm
